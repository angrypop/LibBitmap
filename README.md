## How to get started?
Simply clone this repo, then open the .sln project file using Visual Studio.

Put your input bitmap images at `./Image`, and create a main.cpp to write your code.

## Any tutorials?
`main_filtering.cpp` and `main_lineartransform.cpp` provide some helpful examples (on image I/O, filtering, and linear transformations). Call main_filtering() or main_LinearTransform() to check it out!
